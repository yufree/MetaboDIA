Description: MetaboDIA is novel data extraction framework in DIA-MS for metabolomics applications.
 With the availability of multiple samples, the MS1-centric identification step enables building a consensus MS/MS spectral assay library over samples.
 It can perform targeted extraction of transition-level peak areas for each precursor metabolite with additional retention time alignment.
 A key advantage is that spectral assay libraries can be built using independent DDA runs, or internally within the same DIA data set.
